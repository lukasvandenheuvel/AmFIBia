training, degree-granting programs, and research and development that are part of the instructional functions of the institution.
Without limiting the foregoing, Academic Licenses may not be used for commercial, professional or productive purposes,
for commercial training or any other for-profit purposes. In the event that Company determines that the use by the Buyer was
not Academic Use, Company may in its sole discretion invoice the Buyer for the difference in cost of a commercial entity license

for any recipe it creates using the Software or any scripts it downloads.
<br><br>

IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT. NO WARRANTIES SHALL ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FROM COURSE OF DEALING,
COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
<br><br>

The Software and documentation and any copies, translations, compilations, partial copies, modifications, improvements,
enhancements and updates are proprietary to Company or its licensors, and contain copyrighted material,
trade secrets and other proprietary material. In order to protect such intellectual property rights and preserve
the confidentiality of the Software, Buyer may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce
the Software to a human-perceivable form, except to the extent expressly permitted by mandatory provisions of
applicable law (including national laws implementing Directive 91/250/EEC on the legal protection of computer programs)
in order to gain certain information specified therein, provided that Buyer shall not exercise its rights under such laws,
unless and until Buyer has first requested the required information from Company in writing, and Company, at its sole discretion,
has not complied with Buyer’s request within a commercially reasonable period of time. Buyer may not modify, network,
rent, lease, loan, distribute or create derivative works (other than the scripts) based upon the Software, in whole or in part.
Buyer shall not remove any proprietary notices from any part of the Software or documentation.
Licensors of third party software that may be included in the Software have all the rights and benefits of Company under this license,
and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall have no liability for any damages, whether direct, indirect,
incidental or consequential, arising from the use of such third party software.
Buyer shall not make Software available in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Company,
which consent may be contingent upon the payment of a transfer fee for the Software.
Company reserves the right to audit compliance with the terms of this license, including without limitation whether
or not the Buyer is complying with any Academic Use restrictions, if any.
<br><br>

IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES
ALTHOUGH COMPANY MAY BE INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER LIABILITY TO BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE DELIVERY OR NON-DELIVERY, SALE, MAINTENANCE, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCT, INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY,
BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT,
IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY’S OR COMPANY’S SUPPLIERS’ LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID
FOR THE PRODUCT BY BUYER. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PRICING OF THE PRODUCT AND THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT COMPANY WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS OF ITS LIABILITY.

NON-INFRINGEMENT AND NON-INTERFERENCE ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.
ENTHOUGHT SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE DELIVERED HEREUNDER
FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL ENTHOUGHT’S LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE
AMOUNT OF FEES PAID TO ENTHOUGHT BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER.

<h3>13. Indemnity</h3>

Enthought will defend Customer against any action brought against Customer by a third party to the extent that it is based on
a claim that the Software infringes a United States copyright, patent or other property right, and indemnify and hold
Customer harmless against any and all costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) ("Losses") finally awarded
against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in a written settlement agreement signed by Enthought
arising directly out of such claim. The foregoing is subject to the following: (a) Customer must notify Enthought promptly,
in writing, of the claim, (b) Enthought shall have sole control of the defense of any such claim and all related settlement
negotiations, and (c) Customer shall provide Enthought with reasonable assistance and information and authority to perform the above.
<br><br>
Notwithstanding this general indemnity, Enthought shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on (i) use of a
superseded or altered release of the Software, (ii) the combination, operation or use of the Software with programs or
data not furnished by Enthought if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software without such programs
or data, (iii) any modification of the Software, (iv) any unauthorized use of the Software, or (v) any Third Party Software.
<br><br>
If, due to a claim contemplated above or the threat thereof, (i) the Software is held by a court of competent jurisdiction, or in
Enthought’s reasonable judgment may be held to infringe by such a court, or (ii) Customer receives a valid court order enjoining
Customer from using any of the Software, or in Enthought’s reasonable judgment Customer may receive such an order,
Enthought shall in its reasonable judgment, and at its expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software,
or (b) replace or modify the Software to make it non-infringing.
If neither of the above options are or would likely be available on a basis that Enthought believes to be
commercially reasonable, then Enthought may terminate this Agreement and refund any un-used portion of
the Annual Subscription Fees paid by Customer.
<br>
THIS SECTION STATES ENTHOUGHT’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT.

<h3>14. Remedies</h3>

The parties agree that due to the proprietary nature and high value of the Software, any breach of this Agreement by Customer
will result in irreparable injury to Enthought that cannot be compensated solely by damages.
Therefore, Enthought shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief to protect the Software without posting bond.
In addition to its other remedies, Enthought shall also be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in connection
with enforcement of this Agreement and collection of damages related thereto.

<h3>15. General</h3>

<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <u>Governing Law.</u> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without
        giving effect to any body of law or precedent relating to conflicts of law, and all disputes arising under this Agreement shall
        be brought exclusively in a federal or state court located in Travis County, Texas. Customer consents to the personal jurisdiction
        of such courts, and hereby waives any objection to the venue of such courts.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Assignment.</u> Customer shall not assign any of its rights hereunder without the prior written permission of Enthought.
        Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Severability.</u> In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
        the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>U.S. Government Restricted Rights.</u> In the event Customer is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States
        Government ("Government"), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software,
        or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data or manuals, is restricted in accordance with Federal
        Acquisition Regulation 12.212 (as amended or supplanted) for civilian agencies and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
        Supplement 227.7202 (as amended or supplanted) for military agencies.  The Software is commercial computer software and the
        related documentation is commercial computer software documentation.  The use of the Software and related documentation is
        further restricted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or any modification hereto.
         The Contractor/Manufacturer is Enthought, Inc., 200 West Cesar Chavez, Suite 202, Austin, Texas, U.S.A. 78701.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Export Restrictions.</u> The Software is subject to the United States Export Administration Regulations.
        The following table sets forth the export control status for the Software:<br><br>

        Enthought Product&nbsp;&nbsp;ECCN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License<br>
        Canopy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EAR99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No License Required<br><br>

        This export control classification is for software which uses encryption technology and is eligible for export to all
        countries, with certain exceptions. Enthought products with this classification contain ancillary cryptography due to
        the inclusion of OpenSSL open source software.  Since the Software is not primarily useful for communication,
        Enthought has self-classified the OpenSSL component as EAR99.  Further, pursuant to License Exception TSU - §742.15(b),
        the OpenSSL component of the Software can be exported as NLR, no license required except to those countries embargoed
        by the United States.  By accepting this Agreement, you warrant and represent to Enthought that you will comply with all
        applicable export regulations for the Software as described and incorporated by reference herein.
    </li>
    <li>
        Entire Agreement. Each party acknowledges that it has read and understands this Agreement and agrees to be bound by its terms.
        This Agreement constitutes the complete Agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements or representations,
        written or oral, with respect to the Software. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed
        by a duly authorized representative of each party.
        In the event the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a purchase order issued by Customer conflict,
        the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
    </li>
    <li>
        Force Majeure. Dates or times by which Enthought is required to make performance under this Agreement shall be postponed
        automatically to the extent that Enthought is prevented from meeting them by causes beyond its reasonable control.
    </li>
    <li>
        Waiver. The waiver or failure of Enthought to exercise in any respect any right provided for in this Agreement shall
        not be deemed a waiver of any further right hereunder.
    </li>

<h3>2. Grant of Copyright License.</h3>

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

<h3>3. Grant of Patent License.</h3>

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,

claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    </li>
    <li>
        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
    </li>

        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
    </li>
    <li>
        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
    </li>
</ol>

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

<h3>5. Submission of Contributions.</h3>

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

<h3>6. Trademarks.</h3>

any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

<h3>8. Limitation of Liability.</h3>

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable
to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

<h3>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</h3>

warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
