	<h1>Coordinate systems</h1>

	<p>
	    In this chapter, we explore the coordinate systems employed across various functional domains within the AutoScript API.
	</p>

	<h2>Stage coordinate system</h2>

	<p>
    	The picture below shows the orientation of stage axes X, Y, Z, R and T.
    	The orientation of the Z axis is reversed when the "Link Z to FWD (free working distance)" function is activated.
    	See <a href="../../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/sdb_microscope/specimen/_stage/Stage/link.html">specimen.stage.link()</a>
    	and <a href="../../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/sdb_microscope/specimen/_stage/Stage/unlink.html">specimen.stage.unlink()</a> for details.
	</p>

    <h2>Scanning reduced area coordinate system</h2>

    <p>
        "Reduced area" is one of the <a href="../../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/enumerations/ScanningMode/ScanningMode.html">supported scanning modes</a>.
        In this mode, the beam scans a rectangular sub-region within the entire field of view.
        The area is defined by the coordinates of its upper-left corner, as well as its width and height.
        The field of view spans from [0, 0] at the upper-left corner to [1, 1] at the lower-right corner.
    </p>

    <h2>Patterning coordinate system</h2>

    <p>
        Pattern shapes for patterning jobs are created within a special coordinate system that uses the center of the field
        of view as its origin. The position and size of patterns are directly specified in distance units (meters),
        within the bounds of the current scan field width and height.
    </p>

    <h2>Imaging views numbering</h2>

    <p>
        AutoScript and the main microscope user interface application, "Microscope Control," share the concept of imaging views.
        There are four views numbered from 1 to 4, which divide the screen area into equal-sized quadrants.
        Each view can be configured with a specific beam type, referred to as the Imaging Device in AutoScript.
        In the Microscope Control application, the views are positioned as follows:

    <h2>EDS Regions</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="../../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/_structures_eds/Region/Region.html">Regions</a> in AutoScript unify the coordinate
        systems of various imaging and patterning objects, such as reduced area, spot and patterns, into a common unit of measurement: pixels.
        When coordinates are specified in pixels, they are relative to the current scanning resolution of the electron beam,
        which is can be determined by reading <a href="../../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/sdb_microscope/beams/electron_beam/scanning/_resolution/Resolution/value.html">beams.electron_beam.scanning.resolution.value</a>.
        The upper-left corner of the field of view has the coordinate [0, 0], and the lower-right corner is represented by [Resolution X, Resolution Y].
